# homeopatia.cz
Homeopathy is harmful and causes deaths.
[Homeopatia.cz](http://homeopatia.cz) is a small Slovak site (don't let the domain confuse you) inspired by portals like [What's the Harm?](http://whatstheharm.net/).

Everything I made is free to use under the MIT licence. Photos and Bootstrap belong to their respective authors.

### Domain
Originally hosted on [homeopatik.eu](http://homeopatik.eu). I know that homeopathy translates to *homeopatie* in czech, but I figure Czech TLD might be still lucrative for a Slovak site.

Stage environment is located at [port.yreg.me/homeopatia-dev](http://port.yreg.me/homeopatia-dev)
